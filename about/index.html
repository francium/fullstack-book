    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      This is a book about fullstack web development &mdash; just as the title
      suggests. My goal with this book is to describe all levels of web
      application sufficient enough that the reader can come away with a
      sufficient understanding of all the details at every relevant level.
      However, given the broad scope of this domain, the book will try to go only
      to a reasonable level of detail and explanation. Wherever possible addition
      references and pointers to resources will be made available for interested
      readers.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book is my first venture into writing a book. As such, I do expect
      this to be long and arduous, but I also expect it to be an adventure of a
      lifetime.
    </p>

      <b>This book is in a very early draft state right now. Expect many mistakes
        and incomplete sections.</b> You can find the latest version on the web
      at <a href="https://fullstackbook.rmrf.ca">https://fullstackbook.rmrf.ca</a>.
      Expect the book available on the web to be regularly updated and for its
      contents to change as it is written, revised and edited.
