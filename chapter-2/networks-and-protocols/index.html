    Networks and Protocols
  </h2>

  <section>
    <p>
      The simplest possible definition of a network could be: a collection of
      interconnected nodes. A protocol is the agreement between nodes or
      applications on how to send messages to each other. How the nodes are
      nodes and how they communicate amongst each other is the focus of this
      chapter.
    </p>

    <h3>Networks</h3>

    <h4>Network Architecture an Topology</h4>

    <p>
      There's an exponential number of ways in which you could connect a group
      of nodes together, but having nodes organized and connected in
      arbitrary ways may not be ideal in all cases. Some use cases like
      peer-to-peer systems, direct connections between and all computers in a
      network is a desirable trait. However, in a large business, having every
      node connected to every other can be a security and maintenance disaster.
      Choosing how your computers are organized in a network depends largely on
      the requirements of the systems you're designing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of the most common network architectures, or topologies,
      are<a class="citation" href="#ref1">[1]</a>:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Ring</li>
        <li>Mesh</li>
        <li>Start</li>
        <li>Line</li>
        <li>Tree</li>
        <li>Bus</li>
        <li>Fully Connected</li>
      </ul>
    

    <p>
      Looking at the real world we can discuss common network architectures
      being used in practice as well. At the highest level there is the
      internet, which can be best described as a "network of
      networks"<a class="citation" href="#ref2">[2]</a>. Before we describe the architecture of the
      internet, let's look at smaller networks. Most users would gain access to
      the internet through an internet service provider (ISP). An ISP have may be one
      or more intermediary nodes between your local network and the rest of the
      internet. Your local network would likely follow the star topology in the
      simplest case. Revisiting the internet, we can describe the overall
      structure of the internet as a recursive structure where at the highest
      level you have large internet infrastructure providers who connect smaller
      internet infrastructure providers together. One level below you have
      smaller providers and so on. Hence "network of networks".
