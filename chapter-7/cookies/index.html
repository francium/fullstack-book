    The purpose of this first chapter is to outline the history of the internet and
    describe, at a high level, fullstack development. First we will outline the
    history of the internet and how it came to be. From there we will look at the
    modern internet and how it became an integral part of modern life. We'll also
    briefly discuss what the future may hold for the internet. Finally we'll close
    off this chapter by discussing fullstack development and laying the foundation
    from which we can build our knowledge in the rest of this book.
    </p>

    <p>
    Some readers may choose to skip to the end of this chapter if they're not
    interest in the history of the internet and early computer networks.

  <h3>Early Networks</h3>

  <p>
    The 1960's and 1970's laid the foundation of modern networking, computer network
    and the future invention of the internet. During the 1960's many different
    groups were interested in computer networks and had begun, at roughly the same
    time, doing research and development into early computer networks. By the 1970's
    initial computer applications had begun to come out that utilized the early
    computer networks. The most notable being electronic mail (email), which
    became one of the most widely used networked applications and foreshadowed the
    boom of "people-to-people" traffic that would take place on the modern internet
    a few decades in the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the first few decades, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the only places that had
    access to the network, the ARPANET, were universities, colleges, government
    organization and military organizations. Over time, the network expanded to
    other countries and by the 1990s the original ARPANET had grown into the
    internet that spanned the entire globe.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the 1980s personal computers were beginning to be widely available and had
    started to become common in everyday life. During this period the internet
    spread from it's original educational and research roots into a general purpose
    utility for both personal and commercial use. Then open nature of the internet
    nurtured and encouraged its uptake and growth. The underlying infrastructure,
    the protocols that facilitate data transfer on the internet, provided a general
    purpose platform on top of which a wide variety of applications could thrive.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee purposed a hypertext system and pioneered (citation
    needed) the early world wide web. The 1990s were a frenzy of activity. The NSF
    lifted restrictions on commercial use of the internet and the flood gates really
    opened for the modern internet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course a thorough accounting of the history and events surrounding the early
    networks and internet could take up multiple books alone. Interested readers can
    find starting points in the references at the end of this chapter.

  <h3>The Internet and the World Wide Web</h3>

  <p>
    The 1990's and 2000's were a frenzy of activity. Billions in investment were
    being made in commercial sector. This frenzy led to many fundamental building
    blocks, innovations and key components of the internet, but it resulted in a
    massive economic bubble at the turn of the century, now known as the Dotcom
    Bubble. Many companies, without sound fundamentals, came and went during the
    period. But others, now common names that almost anyone with a electronic device
    and access to the internet would know, came out of this period and went on to
    become some of the largest and most powerful companies to exist.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first three decades of the internet, 1990's, 2000's and 2010's came be split
    into two periods: the Web 1.0 era and the Web 2.0 era. The Web 1.0 era saw
    websites that were primarily static and without many ways for user to engage
    with. This all changed in the 2000's when websites became dynamic and
    emphasized user-generated content.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 2010's saw the rise of internet giants, whose platforms, no longer just
    mere websites, became integrated into daily life of billions of users. Yet,
    while a handful of giants became the face of the modern internet, countless
    others build their businesses on the internet. It is said every company is now a
    technology company -- at least in one way of another, as very few companies can
    now afford to or practically functional without utilizing the internet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly, modern life is now so reliant on the internet that if the internet
    stopped working modern life itself would come to a standstill. Without much
    effort you can see how much of your life relies on the internet: phones, video
    games, technology in classrooms, online banking, credit cards, socialization
    (social networks), television/movies, commerce/shopping, office work, logistics,
    navigation, government services, hospitals, news and numerous other examples.
  </p>

<section>
  <h3>The Future</h3>

  <p>
    It's hard to predict the future, but one thing is for sure: the internet will
    continue to exist and be a big part of daily life. The interesting thing about
    the internet is that is is constantly evolving. It's a dynamic network that
    changes over time. While the core principles will continue to exist, the
    internet in 2030 or 2040 and beyond may look and be used quite differently than
    it was in the 1990's or 2000's or the 2010's.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few ideas worth mentoring are: decentralization, centralization,
    commercialization, balkanization and Web 3.0.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's look at decentralization and centralization. It may sound contradictory,
    but there's an ongoing tension between forces that are pulling the internet
    towards decentralization and centralization. If you look at the very nature of
    the internet, it was based around the idea of anyone being able to host a server
    and anyone else on the same network (the internet at the global level) being
    able to access it. This allowed a natural decentral architecture of the internet
    to develop. There are numerous other protocol that encourage this such as
    BitTorrent and more recently the Fediverse. In contrast, during the 2000s and
    more so during the 2010s we saw a great wave of centralization of the internet
    due to large commercial internet companies dominating key internet markets. This
    has led to isolated communities that are highly controlled and in a sense
    isolated from the rest of the internet. One viewpoint of the future may
    envision a future of even more centralization and a slow decline of
    decentralized nature of the internet. Another may envision of a future that has
    the internet go back to its decentralized roots and embrace decentralization.
  </p>

  <p>
    The discussion of centralization also leads to a discussion of the
    commercialization of the internet. Since the 1990's the internet has become the
    primary means of conducting business. More recently companies have begun to
    operate on the notion of selling attention rather than selling products.
    Regardless, companies are increasingly looking to commercialize the internet for
    financial gain. This is a far cry from the original research and educational
    roots of the internet. In the future it's likely to continue as we see companies
    continues to build businesses on the internet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Balkanization is the idea the internet could become fragments into isolated
    networks with little exchange and only across tightly controlled exchange
    points. There are numerous examples of governments of various that have
    implemented restrictions on access to the internet for their citizens. This is
    not a book about geopolitics so we will refrain for mentioning specifics.
    However, it's possible due to geopolitical circumstances we see a rise in
    restrictions and self-imposed isolation of the internet between countries.
  </p>

<section>
  <h3>Fullstack Development</h3>

  <p>
    We will close off this chapter with a high level overview of fullstack
    development. A fullstack application, in the context of the internet and
    computer networks, generally refers to a system of networked computer programs
    that are engineered to work together to allow a user to perform some task. Many
    fullstack applications consist of 3 major components: a user interface, an
    application server, and a data storage layer. There's no hard rule and
    additional components are integrated as necessary for the application to
    function. In contrast, some people refer to fullstack in a more general sense:
    systems that also include hardware design, firmwares, operating systems, other
    low level components, or any combination of these. We will use the term
    fullstack in a more narrow scope: internet and networked systems that consist of
    a user interface, an application server, data storage layer and possibly other
    higher level components, but without including any lower level components in our
    design and engineering efforts.
  </p>

  <p>
    The design and architecture of a fullstack application can vary greatly. It
    really depends on the functional and non-functional requirements of the problem
    being solved. For example, a home security system may closely follow the 3
    component design we previously mentioned: a user interface for the user to
    interact with the system, an application server that will handle requests from
    the user interface and handle incoming data feeds (security cameras, sensors,
    etc), and a data storage layer for storing data about the security system and
    data feeds. On the other hand, at the very other extreme, for example, an online
    shopping website may have multiple user interfaces, multiple application
    servers, and multiple data storage layers, as well as other components and
    integrations. In simple cases, the entire system may be running on a single
    computer or server, but as the system gets more complex it may be split up and
    run on multiple distinct servers. There a generally three options system
    designers can choose when deploying a fullstack application: the end user's
    computer, servers your own and manages yourself, servers that someone else
    owns and manages for you or an combination of these options.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    <h4>Servers and Computers</h4>
    <p>
      Throughout this book you may see the words "server" and "computer". A server is
      a computer, but a computer may or may not be a server. A server is a computer
      used to serve data for other computers and handle requetss from other computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Generally your own computer wouldn't be a server. But if you're developing
      fullstack applications then it may be considered a server temporary while you
      are running an application server on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      An application server is a computer program that utilizes network protocols and
      the underlying networking capabilities of a computer to serve data and handle
      requests.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    There are many concepts and topics to learn when it comes to fullstack
    development. This book tries to cover many of them, but each concept and topics
    could, and do, easily take one or more books to cover fully. You will find numerous
    books and resources for any concept and topic we cover in this book. For the
    sake of keeping this book feasible, we will choose to cover most things at a
    high level, diving into specifics only if necessary to get the main points
    across.
  </p>

  <p>
    Someone new to fullstack application development could easily feel overwhelmed
    by the amount of things they may think it takes to develop fullstack application
    at first glance. However, fear not, this book is meant to be comprehensive and
    it covers a lot more than the bare minimums one needs to be productive. While
    this book is a resource for many ideas, it is not a good starting point for
    someone new to programming or application development. If you're in such a
    situation, it may be beneficial to revisit this book at a future date when you
    have understood the basics. However, an ambitious novice may choose to read this
    book non the less and at the very minimum come away with a foundation on which
    to build up other knowledge and experience.

## -- Notes --

- **History of the Internet**
  - %Notes
    - The 1960 and 1970 lay the foundations
      - “Galactic Network” concept. He envisioned a globally interconnected
        set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and
        programs from any site
        - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
      - Kleinrock convinced Roberts of the theoretical feasibility of
        communications using packets rather than circuits...circuit switched
        telephone system was totally inadequate for the job. Kleinrock’s
        conviction of the need for packet switching was confirmed.
        - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
      - It happened that the work at MIT (1961-1967), at RAND (1962-1965), and
        at NPL (1964-1967) had all proceeded in parallel without any of the
        researchers knowing about the other work.
        - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
      - In December 1970 the Network Working Group (NWG) working under S.
        Crocker finished the initial ARPANET Host-to-Host protocol, called the
        Network Control Protocol (NCP). As the ARPANET sites completed
        implementing NCP during the period 1971-1972, the network users
        finally could begin to develop applications.
        - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
      - in 1972 that the initial “hot” application, electronic mail, was
        introduced. In March Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote the basic email
        message send and read software, motivated by the need of the ARPANET
        developers for an easy coordination mechanism. In July, Roberts
        expanded its utility by writing the first email utility program to
        list, selectively read, file, forward, and respond to messages. From
        there email took off as the largest network application for over a
        decade. This was a harbinger of the kind of activity we see on the
        World Wide Web today, namely, the enormous growth of all kinds of
        “people-to-people” traffic.
        - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
      - However, while file transfer and remote login (Telnet) were very
        important applications, electronic mail has probably had the most
        significant impact of the innovations from that era. Email provided a
        new model of how people could communicate with each other, and changed
        the nature of collaboration, first in the building of the Internet
        itself (as is discussed below) and later for much of society.
        - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
      - The original ARPANET grew into the Internet. Internet was based on the
        idea that there would be multiple independent networks of rather
        arbitrary design, beginning with the ARPANET as the pioneering packet
        switching network
        - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
      - There were other applications proposed in the early days of the
        Internet, including packet based voice communication (the precursor of
        Internet telephony), various models of file and disk sharing, and
        early “worm” programs that showed the concept of agents (and, of
        course, viruses). A key concept of the Internet is that it was not
        designed for just one application, but as a general infrastructure on
        which new applications could be conceived, as illustrated later by the
        emergence of the World Wide Web. It is the general purpose nature of
        the service provided by TCP and IP that makes this possible.
        - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
    - The internet starts to take shape in the 1980s
      - Widespread development of LANS, PCs and workstations in the 1980s
        allowed the nascent Internet to flourish
          - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
      - Starting in the early 1980’s and continuing to this day, the Internet
        grew beyond its primarily research roots to include both a broad user
        community and increased commercial activity
    - A key to the rapid growth of the Internet has been the free and open
      access to the basic documents, especially the specifications of the
      protocols.
      - The beginnings of the ARPANET and the Internet in the university
        research community promoted the academic tradition of open publication
        of ideas and results. However, the normal cycle of traditional
        academic publication was too formal and too slow for the dynamic
        exchange of ideas essential to creating networks.
      - In 1969 a key step was taken by S. Crocker (then at UCLA) in
        establishing the Request for Comments (or RFC) series of notes. These
        memos were intended to be an informal fast distribution way to share
        ideas with other network researchers.
      - The RFCs are now viewed as the “documents of record” in the Internet
        engineering and standards community.
      - The open access to the RFCs (for free, if you have any kind of a
        connection to the Internet) promotes the growth of the Internet
        because it allows the actual specifications to be used for examples in
        college classes and by entrepreneurs developing new systems.
      - The IETF now has in excess of 75 working groups, each working on a
        different aspect of Internet engineering. Each of these working groups
        has a mailing list to discuss one or more draft documents under
        development. When consensus is reached on a draft document it may be
        distributed as an RFC.
      - As the current rapid expansion of the Internet is fueled by the
        realization of its capability to promote information sharing, we
        should understand that the network’s first role in information sharing
        was sharing the information about its own design and operation through
        the RFC documents. This unique method for evolving new capabilities in
        the network will continue to be critical to future evolution of the
        Internet.
      - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
    - by 1985 there was a tremendous growth in the more practical/engineering
      side of the Internet
      - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
    - This growth was complemented by a major expansion in the community. No
      longer was DARPA the only major player in the funding of the Internet.
      In addition to NSFNet and the various US and international
      government-funded activities, interest in the commercial sector was
      beginning to grow.
      - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
    - A major shift occurred as a result of the increase in scale of the
      Internet and its associated management issues. To make it easy for
      people to use the network, hosts were assigned names, so that it was not
      necessary to remember the numeric addresses. Originally, there were a
      fairly limited number of hosts, so it was feasible to maintain a single
      table of all the hosts and their associated names and addresses. The
      shift to having a large number of independently managed networks (e.g.,
      LANs) meant that having a single table of hosts was no longer feasible,
      and the Domain Name System (DNS) was invented by Paul Mockapetris of
      USC/ISI. The DNS permitted a scalable distributed mechanism for
      resolving hierarchical host names (e.g. www.acm.org) into an Internet
      address.

    - by 1990 when the ARPANET itself was finally decommissioned10, TCP/IP had
      supplanted or marginalized most other wide-area computer network
      protocols worldwide, and IP was well on its way to becoming THE bearer
      service for the Global Information Infrastructure.
      - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
    - New network service providers including PSINet, Alternet, CERFNet, ANS

      customers. NSFNET was no longer the de facto backbone and exchange point
      of the Internet.

      described herein.
    - [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
  - The Internet has changed much in the two decades since it came into
    existence. It was conceived in the era of time-sharing, but has survived
    into the era of personal computers, client-server and peer-to-peer
    computing, and the network computer. It was designed before LANs existed,
    but has accommodated that new network technology, as well as the more
    recent ATM and frame switched services. It was envisioned as supporting a
    range of functions from file sharing and remote login to resource sharing
    and collaboration, and has spawned electronic mail and more recently the
    World Wide Web. But most important, it started as the creation of a small
    band of dedicated researchers, and has grown to be a commercial success
    with billions of dollars of annual investment.
    - [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
  - n the last few years, we have seen a new phase of commercialization.
    Originally, commercial efforts mainly comprised vendors providing the
    basic networking products, and service providers offering the connectivity
    and basic Internet services. The Internet has now become almost a
    “commodity” service, and much of the latest attention has been on the use
    of this global information infrastructure for support of other commercial
    services. This has been tremendously accelerated by the widespread and
    rapid adoption of browsers and the World Wide Web technology, allowing
    users easy access to information linked throughout the globe. Products are
    available to facilitate the provisioning of that information and many of
    the latest developments in technology have been aimed at providing
    increasingly sophisticated information services on top of the basic
    Internet data communications.
    - ref [A Brief History of the Internet - Internet Society](https://www.isoc.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/)
  - Start in the mid 1990s, soon after the commercialization of the internet
    and world wide web the Internet was widely used for mailing lists, emails,
    e-commerce and early popular online shopping (Amazon and eBay for
    example), online forums and bulletin boards, and personal websites and
    blogs, and use was growing rapidly, but by more modern standards the
    systems used were static and lacked widespread social engagement.

    communications technology to gradually develop into a key part of global
    society's infrastructure.

  - Web 1.0
    - The history of the World Wide Web (from 1989 to) up to around 2004 was
      retrospectively named and described by some as "Web 1.0".[156]
    - Typical design elements of these "Web 1.0" era websites included:[152]
      Static pages instead of dynamic HTML;[153] content served from
      filesystems instead of relational databases; pages built using Server
      Side Includes or CGI instead of a web application written in a dynamic
      programming language; HTML 3.2-era structures such as frames and tables
      to create page layouts; online guestbooks; overuse of GIF buttons and
      similar small graphics promoting particular items;[154] and HTML forms
      sent via email. (Support for server side scripting was rare on shared
      servers so the usual feedback mechanism was via email, using mailto
      forms and their email program.[155]
    - During the period 1997 to 2001, the first speculative investment bubble
      related to the Internet took place, in which "dot-com" companies
      (referring to the ".com" top level domain used by businesses) were
      propelled to exceedingly high valuations as investors rapidly stoked
      stock values, followed by a market crash; the first dot-com bubble.
      However this only temporarily slowed enthusiasm and growth, which
      quickly recovered and continued to grow.

  - Web 2.0
    - The term was coined by Darcy DiNucci in 1999[3] and later popularized by
      Tim O'Reilly and Dale Dougherty at the first Web 2.0 Conference in 2004.
      - The term "Web 2.0" was coined by Darcy DiNucci, an information
        architecture consultant, in her January 1999 article "Fragmented
        Future":[3][21]
        - The Web we know now, which loads into a browser window in
          essentially static screenfuls, is only an embryo of the Web to come.
          The first glimmerings of Web 2.0 are beginning to appear, and we are
          just starting to see how that embryo might develop. The Web will be
          understood not as screenfuls of text and graphics but as a transport
          mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens. It will
          [...] appear on your computer screen, [...] on your TV set [...]
          your car dashboard [...] your cell phone [...] hand-held game
          machines [...] maybe even your microwave oven.
    - Although the term mimics the numbering of software versions, it does not
      denote a formal change in the nature of the World Wide Web,[7] but
      merely describes a general change that occurred during this period as
      interactive websites proliferated and came to overshadow the older, more
      static websites of the original Web.[8]
    - websites that emphasize user-generated content, ease of use,
      participatory culture and interoperability (i.e., compatibility with
      other products, systems, and devices) for end users.
    - Web 2.0 introduced new features, such as multimedia content and
      interactive web applications
    - Tim O'Reilly outlined their definition of the "Web as Platform", where
      software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the
      desktop
    - Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web searches based
      on reputation through its "PageRank" algorithm. Unlike software, which
      undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a
      process called "the perpetual beta".
    - The popularity of Web 2.0 was acknowledged by 2006 TIME magazine Person
      of The Year (You).[28] That is, TIME selected the masses of users who
      were participating in content creation on social networks, blogs, wikis,
      and media sharing sites.

- **The Future**
  - One should not conclude that the Internet has now finished changing. The
    Internet, although a network in name and geography, is a creature of the
    computer, not the traditional network of the telephone or television
    industry. It will, indeed it must, continue to change and evolve at the
    speed of the computer industry if it is to remain relevant. It is now
    changing to provide new services such as real time transport, in order to
    support, for example, audio and video streams.
