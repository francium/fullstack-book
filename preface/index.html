  <h2>Preface</h2>

  <p>
    This book is about understanding fullstack applications and fullstack
    application development from the bottom up. It is not a project based book,
    nor is it a tutorial on fullstack development. Instead is meant to describe
    the key concepts relevant to fullstack development, explain fundamentals
    using descriptions and examples, and discuss the practice of fullstack
    development.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reader is expected to have prior knowledge and a good level of comfort
    with programming in at least one language, but multiple language will
    better. Prior experience developing a backend or fullstack application
    would be greatly beneficial in providing a foundation on which to build
    upon while reading this book. Consequently, this book will not be focusing
    on explaining fundamental of programming, the specific of a language or
    programming concepts.
  </p>

  <p>
    What this book instead does is focus on is a thorough, but not exhaustive,
    overview of fullstack application development. The topic of fullstack
    development is vast and constantly evolving. However, unlike much of the
    material one may find on the internet or in other books, this book instead
    chooses to focus on the key fundamental concepts that transcend the
    technologies, frameworks and libraries du jour. That being said, for the
    sake of explanations, relevance and examples, current popular technologies,
    libraries and frameworks will be mentioned and used in examples as
    necessary. However, we will make an effort to not rely solely on them for
    the purposes of getting the concepts we discuss across to you the reader.
  </p>

  <p>
    Given the vast amount of information available to discuss, some areas may
    not be covered as deeply as others. Covering everything in a single book is
    infeasible and would end up yielding a book that would be too large to
    write or read. Hence, some topics will be covered at higher levels, but we
    will make an effort to provide necessary pointers and references to
    external resources for interested readers.
